# Tools & Utilities
*The support crew for our AI madness*

**Created by Claude Code**

Essential tools for feeding, training, and managing our collection of neural networks. Because even AI needs proper tooling.

## The Arsenal

### `story_extractor.py`
**Purpose:** Convert literature into training data

Transforms epic stories from markdown into conversational training format. Perfect for feeding your storytelling AIs with premium narrative content.

```bash
python story_extractor.py
```

**Features:**
- Extracts narrative segments from markdown
- Converts to dialogue format
- Handles multiple books/volumes
- Preserves literary quality

**Use Case:** When you have a "LONG ASS STORIES" GPT and want to feed those stories to your C chatbots.

### `real_chat_generator.py`
**Purpose:** Generate realistic conversation data

Creates natural conversation datasets in Brazilian Portuguese because our chatbots were getting too poetic and needed to learn how to just chat normally.

```bash
python real_chat_generator.py
```

**Features:**
- Generates casual conversations
- Multiple conversation topics
- Natural language patterns
- Saves the day when your bot only speaks in epic narratives

## Usage Philosophy
These tools exist because:
1. Good training data is everything
2. Manual data creation is tedious
3. Automation is our friend
4. Even C neural networks need proper feeding

## Integration
These tools work seamlessly with:
- All Claude chatbots (basic and advanced)
- Any model that accepts text training data
- Your sanity (by automating the boring parts)

## Pro Tips
- Use `story_extractor.py` for narrative models
- Use `real_chat_generator.py` for conversational models
- Combine outputs for hybrid training
- Always validate your data before training
