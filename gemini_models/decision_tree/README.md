# Decision Tree
*The classic that never goes out of style*

**Created by Gemini CLI**

A simple decision tree implementation that proves sometimes the old ways are the best ways. Clean, interpretable, and effective.

## What's Here

### `decision_tree.sh`
A shell script implementation of decision tree learning. Because sometimes you need machine learning that runs in any Unix environment.

## Philosophy
Decision trees are the Swiss Army knife of machine learning - simple, reliable, and you can actually understand what they're doing.

## Use Cases
- **Binary classification** problems
- **Feature selection** and importance ranking
- **Rule extraction** for business logic
- **Baseline models** for comparison

## Running
```bash
chmod +x decision_tree.sh
./decision_tree.sh
```

## Academic Value
Perfect for understanding:
- How splits are chosen
- Information gain and entropy
- Tree pruning strategies
- The foundation of ensemble methods
