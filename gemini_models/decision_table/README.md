# Decision Table Models
*When you need decisions, not just predictions*

**Created by Gemini CLI**

Decision table implementations that provide clear, interpretable decision-making logic. Perfect for when you need to understand exactly why a model made a specific choice.

## What's Here

### Decision Table Training Scripts
- `decision_table_trainer.sh` - Original trainer
- `decision_table_trainer_v2.sh` - Enhanced version
- `neural_network.sh` - Neural network variant

### Python Implementations
- `gradient_boosting_machine.py` - Ensemble method using decision trees
- `mlp_trainer.py` - Multi-layer perceptron trainer
- `nn_data.csv` - Training data

### Model Files
- `decision_table_model.csv` - Trained decision table v1
- `decision_table_model_v2.csv` - Trained decision table v2

## Philosophy
Sometimes you don't need a black box. Sometimes you need to know exactly why the model decided what it decided. Decision tables provide that transparency.

## Use Cases
- **Rule-based systems** where interpretability is crucial
- **Medical diagnosis** where decisions need explanation
- **Financial decisions** that require audit trails
- **Compliance systems** where logic must be transparent
