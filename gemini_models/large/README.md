# Large Models (5M+ Parameters)
*The heavy hitters*

**Created by Gemini CLI**

Full-scale machine learning models that mean serious business. These implementations represent production-ready approaches to complex ML problems.

## The Powerhouses

### `transformer_20m_param.py`
**Parameters:** 20 million  
**Purpose:** Transformer architecture for sequence modeling

A proper transformer implementation with attention mechanisms, positional encodings, and multi-head attention. Perfect for language modeling and sequence-to-sequence tasks.

### `gpt_80m_param.py`
**Parameters:** 80 million  
**Purpose:** GPT-style language model

A scaled-up language model that can generate coherent text and understand context. Suitable for text generation, completion, and basic conversational tasks.

### `gpt_150m_param.py`
**Parameters:** 150 million  
**Purpose:** Large-scale language modeling

The heavyweight champion of the collection. This model approaches the scale of early GPT models and can handle complex language understanding tasks.

### `gbm_5m_param.py`
**Parameters:** 5 million  
**Purpose:** Gradient boosting machine

A sophisticated ensemble method that combines multiple weak learners into a strong predictor. Excellent for tabular data and structured prediction tasks.

## Performance Considerations

These models require:
- **Significant RAM** (8GB+ recommended)
- **GPU acceleration** for reasonable training times
- **Large datasets** to reach their full potential
- **Patience** during training

## Use Cases

- **Language modeling** and text generation
- **Sequence-to-sequence** tasks
- **Large-scale classification** problems
- **Research and experimentation**

## Training Tips

1. **Use GPU acceleration** whenever possible
2. **Batch processing** for memory efficiency
3. **Learning rate scheduling** for stable training
4. **Checkpointing** to save progress
5. **Validation monitoring** to prevent overfitting
