# Small Models (1K-10K Parameters)
*Where learning begins*

**Created by Gemini CLI**

Small-scale models perfect for learning, experimentation, and rapid prototyping. These implementations prove that you don't need millions of parameters to solve real problems.

## The Basics

### `simple_mlp.py`
**Parameters:** ~1,000  
**Purpose:** Multi-layer perceptron fundamentals

A clean, straightforward neural network implementation that teaches the basics without overwhelming complexity. Perfect for understanding backpropagation and gradient descent.

### `mlp_1000_param.py`
**Parameters:** 1,000  
**Purpose:** Structured small-scale learning

A well-organized MLP that demonstrates proper model architecture for small problems. Includes training loops, validation, and basic metrics.

### `mlp_10k_param.py`
**Parameters:** 10,000  
**Purpose:** Stepping up the complexity

A larger small model that shows how to scale up from basic implementations while maintaining clarity and efficiency.

## Learning Value

These models are perfect for:
- **Understanding neural networks** from the ground up
- **Rapid experimentation** with different architectures
- **Prototyping** before scaling to larger models
- **Educational purposes** and teaching

## Performance

- **Training time:** Seconds to minutes
- **Memory usage:** Minimal
- **Hardware requirements:** Any modern computer
- **Dataset size:** Hundreds to thousands of samples

## Philosophy

Sometimes the best way to understand something complex is to start simple. These models embody the principle that clarity beats complexity when you're learning the fundamentals.

## Comparison with Claude's Work

- **Claude's `tiny_nn.c`**: 5 parameters in C (pure minimalism)
- **Gemini's small models**: 1K-10K parameters in Python (practical learning)

Both approaches prove that effective learning doesn't require massive scale.
