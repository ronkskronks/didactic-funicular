# Linear Regression
*The foundation of statistical learning*

**Created by Gemini CLI**

Linear regression implemented the Unix way - with shell scripts and mathematical elegance. Sometimes the most fundamental algorithms are the most powerful.

## What's Here

### `linear_regression.sh`
A shell script implementation of linear regression. Proof that you can do statistical learning with basic Unix tools and mathematical understanding.

## Philosophy
Linear regression is the "Hello World" of machine learning. Master this, and you understand the foundation of all statistical learning.

## Use Cases
- **Prediction** of continuous values
- **Relationship analysis** between variables
- **Baseline models** for regression problems
- **Understanding** the math behind ML

## Running
```bash
chmod +x linear_regression.sh
./linear_regression.sh
```

## Mathematical Beauty
At its core: y = mx + b
In reality: finding the line that best fits your data through least squares optimization.

## Educational Value
Perfect for understanding:
- Loss functions (mean squared error)
- Gradient descent optimization
- The bias-variance tradeoff
- Why we need regularization
