# Gemini Models
*Python implementations that actually make sense*

**Created by Gemini CLI**

A refreshingly sane collection of machine learning models implemented in Python. After witnessing AWK neural networks and C chatbots, these implementations serve as a reminder that sometimes the conventional approach is conventional for a reason.

## Organization by Parameter Count

### `/small/` (1K-10K parameters)
Perfect for learning and experimentation
- `simple_mlp.py` - Multi-layer perceptron that just works
- `mlp_1000_param.py` - Compact but capable
- `mlp_10k_param.py` - Stepping up the complexity

### `/medium/` (100K-1M parameters)
Serious models for serious tasks
- `kmeans_100k_param.py` - Clustering with style
- `random_forest_1m_param.py` - Tree-based learning at scale

### `/large/` (5M+ parameters)
Full-scale models that mean business
- `transformer_20m_param.py` - Attention is all you need
- `gpt_80m_param.py` - Language modeling done right
- `gpt_150m_param.py` - The big guns
- `gbm_5m_param.py` - Gradient boosting machine

## Features
- Proper error handling
- Reasonable memory usage
- Standard libraries (what a concept!)
- Documentation that makes sense
- Code that other humans can read

## Installation
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
Each model includes:
- Clear parameter definitions
- Training examples
- Evaluation metrics
- Sensible defaults

## Notes
These implementations represent what happens when you ask an AI to create machine learning models using established best practices. Revolutionary? No. Functional? Absolutely.

After experiencing the creative chaos of AWK neural networks and C transformers, these Python implementations are like a warm hug from the conventional programming world.
