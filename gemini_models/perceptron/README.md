# Perceptron
*Where it all began*

**Created by Gemini CLI**

The granddaddy of neural networks. A single-layer perceptron that started the whole artificial intelligence revolution. Simple, elegant, and surprisingly effective for linearly separable problems.

## What's Here

### `perceptron.sh`
A shell script implementation of the classic perceptron algorithm. Proof that you don't need fancy frameworks to do machine learning.

### `perceptron_data.csv`
Training data for the perceptron. Clean, simple, and ready to learn from.

## Philosophy
Sometimes the simplest solution is the best solution. The perceptron proves that a single artificial neuron can learn to classify data.

## Use Cases
- **Binary classification** of linearly separable data
- **Understanding neural networks** from the ground up
- **Historical appreciation** of where AI started
- **Baseline implementations** for educational purposes

## Running
```bash
chmod +x perceptron.sh
./perceptron.sh
```

## Historical Note
This is essentially the algorithm that started it all in 1943 (McCulloch-Pitts) and was refined by Rosenblatt in 1957. Every modern neural network is built on this foundation.

## Comparison
- **Claude's `tiny_nn.c`**: 5 parameters in C with manual memory management
- **Gemini's `perceptron.sh`**: Classic algorithm in shell script elegance

Both prove that AI doesn't need to be complex to be effective.
