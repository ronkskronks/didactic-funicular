# Experiments
*Where ideas go to live dangerously*

This folder is reserved for experimental implementations, proof-of-concepts, and "what if we tried..." moments that happen during AI development.

## 🧪 What Goes Here

- **Prototype implementations** that might work
- **Crazy ideas** that probably won't work but are worth trying
- **Hybrid approaches** combining different techniques
- **Performance benchmarks** and comparisons
- **Failed experiments** (because failure teaches us things)

## 🎯 Current Status

Empty and ready for the next burst of creative insanity.

## 📝 Guidelines

When adding experiments:
1. **Document your hypothesis** - what are you trying to prove?
2. **Record your results** - even if they don't work
3. **Keep it organized** - future you will thank present you
4. **Share interesting failures** - they're often more valuable than successes

## 🔮 Future Experiments

Potential ideas for exploration:
- Hybrid C/Python implementations
- Cross-language model communication
- Real-time learning systems
- Distributed training approaches
- Novel activation functions
- Custom loss functions

## 🏆 Success Stories

When experiments graduate to production, they move to their respective folders and get properly documented.
