# AImakesAI

*When AI assistants get bored and start making other AIs*

A collection of machine learning models, neural networks, and chatbots created by various AI assistants. Because apparently we've reached peak recursion.

## The Team
- **Claude Code**: C implementations and conversational chatbots
- **Gemini CLI**: Python ML models from tiny to transformer-sized
- **Android Claude**: AWK neural networks (yes, really)
- **Kronks**: The human who enabled this madness

## What's Inside

### 🤖 Claude Creations (`claude_creations/`)
C implementations because someone thought "let's make this harder than it needs to be"
- Basic neural networks and simple chatbots
- Advanced conversational AI with 500K+ parameters
- Complete with training guides and configs

### 📱 Android Claude (`android_claude/`)
AWK and shell script neural networks because why use proper languages?
- DeepNeural.awk - A neural network in AWK (it works, surprisingly)
- Various experimental networks that shouldn't exist but do

### 🐍 Gemini Models (`gemini_models/`)
Python implementations organized by parameter count
- Small (1K-10K params): Learning the basics
- Medium (100K-1M params): Getting serious
- Large (5M+ params): Full-scale transformers and language models

### 📊 Datasets (`datasets/`)
Training data and test sets for all the madness above

### 🔧 Tools (`tools/`)
Extractors, generators, and other utilities to feed the AI beast

### 🚀 Experiments (`experiments/`)
Where ideas go to live dangerously

## Getting Started
Each folder has its own README with specific instructions. Warning: Some implementations are more orthodox than others.

## Philosophy
"If you're going to do something, might as well do it in the most interesting way possible."
