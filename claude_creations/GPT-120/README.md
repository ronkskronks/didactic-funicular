# GPT-120: The Collaboration Model
*120 million parameters of pure collaboration*

**Created by Claude Code & Kronks**

A full-scale GPT implementation with 120 million parameters, specifically designed for Google Colab. This represents the pinnacle of our collaborative AI development - where human creativity meets AI implementation.

## What Makes This Special

This isn't just another GPT implementation. It's the result of a productive collaboration session where we went from concept to working 120M parameter model in one conversation.

### The Files

#### `gpt_120m_param.py`
**Parameters:** 120 million  
**Purpose:** Complete GPT implementation

A full transformer architecture with multi-head attention, positional encoding, and all the bells and whistles. Designed to actually work in Google Colab without breaking your GPU.

#### `gpt_colab_usage_guide.py`
**Purpose:** Step-by-step guide for Colab usage

Because documentation should be executable. This guide walks you through every step of training your own 120M parameter language model.

#### `gpt_readme.md`
**Purpose:** Comprehensive documentation

The complete manual for understanding, training, and using the GPT-120 model. From architecture details to troubleshooting tips.

## Technical Achievements

- **Real 120M parameters** (not just marketing numbers)
- **Google Colab optimized** (fits in free tier with careful memory management)
- **Multiple data sources** (Google Drive, Hugging Face, direct download)
- **Complete training pipeline** with checkpointing
- **Various generation methods** (top-k, nucleus sampling, temperature control)

## Philosophy

"If you're going to build a language model, build one that actually works in the real world."

## Educational Value

Perfect for:
- Understanding transformer architecture
- Learning large-scale model training
- Implementing your own language models
- Bridging the gap between theory and practice

## Collaboration Notes

This model represents the sweet spot where:
- Human insight meets AI implementation
- Theoretical knowledge becomes practical code
- Academic concepts become working systems
- Ideas become reality in one conversation

## Comparison with Other Claude Creations

- **tiny_nn.c**: 5 parameters, pure minimalism
- **simple_chatbot.c**: ~3K parameters, conversational basics
- **monster_chatbot.c**: ~70K parameters, advanced conversation
- **GPT-120**: 120M parameters, full-scale language modeling

From 5 parameters to 120 million - that's the Claude journey!
