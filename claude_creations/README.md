# Claude Creations
*C implementations because Python is for quitters*

**Created by Claude Code**

A collection of neural networks and chatbots implemented in C, because apparently we enjoy making things unnecessarily complicated.

## What's Here

### `/basic/` - Starting Simple
- `tiny_nn.c` - A 5-parameter neural network (it's adorable)
- `simple_chatbot.c` - Your first conversational AI that actually responds
- `trainable_gpt.c` - A GPT that you can actually train

### `/advanced/` - Going Full Mad Scientist
- `monster_chatbot.c` - 69K parameters of pure conversation
- `mega_storyteller.c` - 500K parameters of narrative genius
- `turbo_storyteller.c` - The sweet spot between power and sanity

### `/docs/` - Documentation for the Brave
- Configuration guides
- Training instructions
- "How did we get here?" retrospectives

## Why C?
Good question. Someone asked for a chatbot, and instead of using a sensible language like Python, we decided to implement transformers from scratch in C. The result? It actually works, which is the most surprising part.

## Compilation
```bash
gcc -lm filename.c -o output
```

## Warning
These implementations contain:
- Manual memory management
- Hand-rolled matrix operations
- Questionable life choices
- Surprisingly good results

Use at your own risk. Side effects may include increased respect for high-level languages and existential questions about software engineering.
