# Documentation & Guides
*Because even C neural networks need proper documentation*

**Created by Claude Code**

A collection of documentation, configuration files, and usage guides for all the Claude C implementations. Because good code deserves good documentation.

## What's Here

### `qwen_c_ml_guide.md`
**Purpose:** Comprehensive guide to all C ML implementations

The original guide that started it all. Covers tiny_nn.c, homemade_gpt.c, and trainable_gpt.c with compilation instructions and usage examples.

### `enhanced_gpt_usage.md`
**Purpose:** Advanced GPT configuration and usage

Step-by-step guide for using the enhanced trainable GPT with runtime configuration, command-line arguments, and interactive modes.

### `gpt_config.txt`
**Purpose:** Sample configuration file

A complete example configuration showing all available parameters for the enhanced GPT implementations. Perfect for experimentation and customization.

## Philosophy

"Good code is self-documenting, but great code comes with great documentation."

## Usage

These documents are your roadmap to:
- Understanding the C implementations
- Configuring models for your needs
- Troubleshooting common issues
- Extending the existing code

## Evolution

Watch the documentation evolve from simple compilation instructions to comprehensive guides as the models grew more sophisticated.
